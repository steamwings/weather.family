# Weather.Family

This repo is a fork of the [Hometown](https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown/) fork of [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon), customized for my personal instance.

## Differences from Hometown

- All posts are [local-only](https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown/wiki/Local-only-posting) for all profiles _by default_. This can be turned off in user settings like normal, but makes it so that new users don't need to know what federation is.
- ...I'll try to remember to document other tweaks here
